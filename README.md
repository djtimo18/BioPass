# BioPass
A concept for ID autentification on all devices. 


ðŸ“Œ The concept of BioPass is a password safe working with our phone in the form of QRcode.

ðŸ“Œ BioPass is an authentication system based on the biometrics of our phones (FaceID, TouchID ...) made possible and easy to use thanks to the QRcode.

ðŸ“Œ The goal is that when a user wishes to connect to his account, it is sufficient to scan with his phone a QRcode generated by the site and on the BioPass application so that he is connected.

ðŸ“Œ All security rests on the user's phone and their biometric data.
